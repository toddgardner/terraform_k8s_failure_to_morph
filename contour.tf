                           When stored in a Secret, certificates must be PEM encoded and specified within the "ca.crt" data field of the Secret. When multiple certificates are specified, the certificates MUST be concatenated by new lines.
                           CertificateAuthorityRef can also reference a standard Kubernetes resource, i.e. ConfigMap, or an implementation-specific custom resource.

                        DetailedCondition is an extension of the normal Kubernetes conditions, with two extra fields to hold sub-conditions, which provide more detailed reasons for the state (True or False) of the condition.
                         `errors` holds information about sub-conditions which are fatal to that condition and render its state False.
                         `warnings` holds information about sub-conditions which are not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False.
                         Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
                         The type is the type of the condition, the most important one in this CRD set is `Valid`. `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition: when it is `status: true` there are no problems.
                         In more detail, `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into Contour with no errors. `warnings` may still be present, and will be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in the `errors` slice in this case.
                         `Valid`, `status: false` means that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing into Contour.  The details of the errors will be present under the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors` slice if `status` is `false`.
                         For DetailedConditions of types other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity. When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there may be entries in the `warnings` slice.
                         Regardless of the polarity, the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either the detail of the reason (if there is one and only one entry in total across both the `errors` and `warnings` slices), or `MultipleReasons` if there is more than one entry.

                               It is intended for warnings and errors, so `type` names should use abnormal-true polarity, that is, they should be of the form "ErrorPresent: true".
                               The expected lifecycle for these errors is that they should only be present when the error or warning is, and should be removed when they are not relevant.

An implementation MAY also group together and collapse compatible Listeners belonging to different Gateways.
                       For example, an implementation might consider Listeners to be compatible with each other if all of the following conditions are met:
                       1. Either each Listener within the group specifies the "HTTP"    Protocol or each Listener within the group specifies either    the "HTTPS" or "TLS" Protocol.

                       If the implementation does collapse compatible Listeners, the hostname provided in the incoming client request MUST be matched to a Listener to find the correct set of Routes. The incoming hostname MUST be matched using the Hostname field for each Listener in order of most to least specific. That is, exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches.
                       If this field specifies multiple Listeners that have the same Port value but are not compatible, the implementation must raise a "Conflicted" condition in the Listener status.

The wildcard character `*` must appear by itself as the first DNS label and matches only a single label.

                            Routes specifies a schema for associating routes with the Listener using selectors. A Route is a resource capable of servicing a request and allows a cluster operator to expose a cluster resource (i.e. Service) by externally-reachable URL, load-balance traffic and terminate SSL/TLS.  Typically, a route is a "HTTPRoute" or "TCPRoute" in group "networking.x-k8s.io", however, an implementation may support other types of resources.
                             The Routes selector MUST select a set of objects that are compatible with the application protocol specified in the Protocol field.
                             Although a client request may technically match multiple route rules, only one rule may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be determined in order of the following criteria:
                             * The most specific match. For example, the most specific HTTPRoute match   is determined by the longest matching combination of hostname and path. * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with   a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:03" is given precedence over   a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:04". * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in   alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For   example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.
                             All valid portions of a Route selected by this field should be supported. Invalid portions of a Route can be ignored (sometimes that will mean the full Route). If a portion of a Route transitions from valid to invalid, support for that portion of the Route should be dropped to ensure consistency. For example, even if a filter specified by a Route is invalid, the rest of the Route should still be supported.

                                Mode defines the TLS behavior for the TLS session initiated by the client. There are two possible modes: - Terminate: The TLS session between the downstream client   and the Gateway is terminated at the Gateway. This mode requires   certificateRef to be set. - Passthrough: The TLS session is NOT terminated by the Gateway. This   implies that the Gateway can't decipher the TLS stream except for   the ClientHello message of the TLS protocol.   CertificateRef field is ignored in this mode.

                        DetailedCondition is an extension of the normal Kubernetes conditions, with two extra fields to hold sub-conditions, which provide more detailed reasons for the state (True or False) of the condition.
                         `errors` holds information about sub-conditions which are fatal to that condition and render its state False.
                         `warnings` holds information about sub-conditions which are not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False.
                         Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
                         The type is the type of the condition, the most important one in this CRD set is `Valid`. `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition: when it is `status: true` there are no problems.
                         In more detail, `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into Contour with no errors. `warnings` may still be present, and will be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in the `errors` slice in this case.
                         `Valid`, `status: false` means that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing into Contour.  The details of the errors will be present under the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors` slice if `status` is `false`.
                         For DetailedConditions of types other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity. When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there may be entries in the `warnings` slice.
                         Regardless of the polarity, the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either the detail of the reason (if there is one and only one entry in total across both the `errors` and `warnings` slices), or `MultipleReasons` if there is more than one entry.

                      Hostnames defines a set of hostname that should match against the HTTP Host header to select a HTTPRoute to process the request. Hostname is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the "host" part of the URI as defined in the RFC:
                       1. IPs are not allowed. 2. The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed.
                       Incoming requests are matched against the hostnames before the HTTPRoute rules. If no hostname is specified, traffic is routed based on the HTTPRouteRules.
                       Hostname can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. "foo.example.com") or "wildcard", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. `*.example.com`). The wildcard character `*` must appear by itself as the first DNS label and matches only a single label. You cannot have a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == `*`). Requests will be matched against the Host field in the following order:
                       1. If Host is precise, the request matches this rule if    the HTTP Host header is equal to Host. 2. If Host is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule if    the HTTP Host header is to equal to the suffix    (removing the first label) of the wildcard rule.

                                   - Custom: Filters that are defined and supported by specific vendors.   In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple   implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core   conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters   is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to   "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.
                                   Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                                        Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields, types are classified into three conformance levels:
                                         - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by   "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All   implementations must support core filters.
                                         - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by   "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers   are encouraged to support extended filters.
                                         - Custom: Filters that are defined and supported by specific vendors.   In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple   implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core   conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters   is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to   "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.
                                         Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

If the AppProtocol field is available, this annotation should not be used. The AppProtocol field, when populated, takes precedence over the annotation in the BackendPolicy resource. For custom backends, it is encouraged to add a semantically-equivalent field in the Custom Resource Definition.

                             For example, take the following matches configuration:
                             ``` matches: - path:     value: "/foo"   headers:     values:       version: "2" - path:     value: "/v2/foo" ```
                             For a request to match against this rule, a request should satisfy EITHER of the two conditions:
                             - path prefixed with `/foo` AND contains the header `version: "2"` - path prefix of `/v2/foo`
                             See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on how to specify multiple match conditions that should be ANDed together.
                             If no matches are specified, the default is a prefix path match on "/", which has the effect of matching every HTTP request.
                             Each client request MUST map to a maximum of one route rule. If a request matches multiple rules, matching precedence MUST be determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:
                             * The longest matching hostname. * The longest matching path. * The largest number of header matches.
                             If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:
                             * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with   a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:03" is given precedence over   a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:04". * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by   "<namespace>/<name>". For example, foo/bar is given precedence over   foo/baz.
                             If ties still exist within the Route that has been given precedence, matching precedence MUST be granted to the first matching rule meeting the above criteria.

In the absence of the AppProtocol field a `networking.x-k8s.io/app-protocol` annotation on the BackendPolicy resource may be used to define the protocol. If the AppProtocol field is available, this annotation should not be used. The AppProtocol field, when populated, takes precedence over the annotation in the BackendPolicy resource. For custom backends, it is encouraged to add a semantically-equivalent field in the Custom Resource Definition.

                        DetailedCondition is an extension of the normal Kubernetes conditions, with two extra fields to hold sub-conditions, which provide more detailed reasons for the state (True or False) of the condition.
                         `errors` holds information about sub-conditions which are fatal to that condition and render its state False.
                         `warnings` holds information about sub-conditions which are not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False.
                         Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
                         The type is the type of the condition, the most important one in this CRD set is `Valid`. `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition: when it is `status: true` there are no problems.
                         In more detail, `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into Contour with no errors. `warnings` may still be present, and will be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in the `errors` slice in this case.
                         `Valid`, `status: false` means that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing into Contour.  The details of the errors will be present under the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors` slice if `status` is `false`.
                         For DetailedConditions of types other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity. When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there may be entries in the `warnings` slice.
                         Regardless of the polarity, the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either the detail of the reason (if there is one and only one entry in total across both the `errors` and `warnings` slices), or `MultipleReasons` if there is more than one entry.
